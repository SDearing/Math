# Determing Shape Parameters Using Vector Methods
A vector is a representation of a line, a vector has two independent properties: magnitude and direction. Magnitude is the length of the line and the direction is the direction of the line. Vectors can be used to make up shapes and can even indicate the approximate length of lines on the shape.
