##Conditional Probability
Conditional probability is the probability of an event occuring given that another event occured before. For example the probability of rolling a 8 with 2 die. To calculate this we must first work out the total number of probabilities that could occur, we know that with 1 die there are 6 different combinations, but with 2 die there are 6x6 combinations of numbers. This means that there are 36 combinations with 2 die, then we need to work out how many times the combination of numbers from the die could be 8, to do this you can note out the different combinations from a die that make 8: (2,6) (3,5) (4,4) (5,3) (2,6). As you can see we have 5 combinations so the proabilty of 2 die rolling an 8 is 5/36. 

Another example could be the probability of rolling at least one 2 with two die. Again we need to find the total probabilities which would again be 36 combinations of rolls. We then work out the probability of getting at least one 2 which would be 5 times with getting a 2 with one dice, 5 times again with the other dice and once when both die role a 2. This means our probability would be 11/36.

A final example would be the probability of having 7 after rolling a 2. As one of the conditions has already been set are total probability will not be 36 but instead 6 as we are only working with one dice. We then need to calculate how to get a 7 after rolling a 2 which would only be by rolling a 5, this means that the probability having a 7 after rolling a 2 would be 1/6.
