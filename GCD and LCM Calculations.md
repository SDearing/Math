# How to calculate the greatest common divisor of a given pair of numbers?
A divisor is a number that can be divided into another number without leaving a remainder, so the greatest common divisor is the largest divisor of two numbers. To calculate a GCD of two given numbers, you must first note down all the divisors of the two given numbers, then compare the two to find the largest divisor that in both lists that matches, giving you the GCD.

## Example
Below are the divisors of the numbers  18 and 81, the largest number in both lists is 9 so that is the GCD. 

18|1 2 3 6 (9)
81|1 2 4 7 (9) ...


# How to calculate the lowest common-multiple of a given pair of numbers?
A multiple is the result of multipling a given number by a integer, for example a multiple of 5 is 15, so To find the highest-common multiple of two numbers you must first list the prime factors of each number, you then multiply each factor the greatest number of times it occurs in either number, meaning if the same factor occurs more than once in a number then, you multiply the factor that occurs the most.

## Example
Say we had to find the LCM of 50 and 75, we first need to find their prime factors
50| (2)x25
25| (5)x(5)
Prime Factors of 50: 2x5x5

75| (3)x25
25| (5)x(5)
Prime Factors of 75: 3x5x5

We then multiply each factor using two 5s as it occurs twice.
2x3x5x5= 125

This means the LCM of 50 and 75 is 125
