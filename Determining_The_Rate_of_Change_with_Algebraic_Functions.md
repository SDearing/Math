# Determining The Rate of Change with Algebraic Functions
The rate of change is the ratio in which one variable changes as another changes, this calculation is used alot in the real world, for example miles per hour is calculated by dividing the number of miles travelled by the number of hours it takes to travel them.
In general, an average rate of change function is a process that calculates the amount of change in one item divided by the corresponding amount of change in another. In a function notation, we can define the average rate of change of a function *f* from *a* to *x* as:

Examples:
F(x)= x^2

Rate of change from 1 to 3

(3^2 - 1^2)/ (3-1) = (9-1)/(3-2) = 8/2 = 4

4 in binary equals 0000 0100


F(x) 2x + 3

Rate of change from 10 to 100

(2 * 100 + 3) - (2 * 10 + 3) / (100 - 10) = 180 / 90 = 2

2 in binary equals 0000 0010
