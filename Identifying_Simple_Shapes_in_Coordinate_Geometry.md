This equation works out the gradient (the rate of increase/decrease) of a line made by two points on a graph by dividing the difference of the y coordinates by the difference of the x coordinates

Distance Formula:

This equation is used to find the midpoint of a line made by two points on a graph by combining the x coordinates and y coordinates and dividing both results by two to make the coordinates of the midpoint.

Parallel Lines: Lines that both travel at the same angle ||
Perpendicular Lines: Lines that form a 90 degree angle or have reciprocal gradients. L
## Identifying Shapes in coordinate Geometry
All shapes have specific attributes that define them, for example a square has 4 lines of equal length and opposite sides of the square will be parallel. Whereas a triangle only has 3 lines and none of their lines are parallel, there may be a perpindicular lines in a right angled triangle (due to the 90 degree angle). Coordiniate Geometry refers to the creation on shapes in a graph format. Using this format you can create shapes by only plotting different coordinates, for example to make a square it needs to have 2 sets of parallel lines meaning 2 coordinates will need the same x coordinate and the other 2 coordinates will need the same y coordinates. A square will also need all the lines to be the same length the coordinates will have to have the same difference from eachother. So a possible set of coordinates for a square will be (0,2) (2,2) (2,0) (0,0) as the length of all the lines is 2 and the points make 2 parallel lines.
