# Algorithm to Calculate Arithmetic and Geometric Progression
## What is Artithmetic and Geometric progression?
Arithmetic progression is a sequence that goes to each term by adding (or subtracting) the same value. For example the sequence 4,9,14,19,24 is arithmetic as 5 is added each term. The number added (or subtracted) each term is called the 'common difference'. However a geometric progression is a sequence that goes to each term by multiplying (or dividing) by the same value. For example the sequence 4,12,36,108 is geometric as each term is multiplied by 3. The number that is used to multiply (or divide) each term is called the common ratio.
