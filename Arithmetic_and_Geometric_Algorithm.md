# Algorithm to Calculate Arithmetic and Geometric Progression
## What is Artithmetic and Geometric progression?
Arithmetic progression is a sequence that goes to each term by adding (or subtracting) the same value. For example the sequence 4,9,14,19,24 is arithmetic as 5 is added each term. The number added (or subtracted) each term is called the 'common difference'. However a geometric progression is a sequence that goes to each term by multiplying (or dividing) by the same value. For example the sequence 4,12,36,108 is geometric as each term is multiplied by 3. The number that is used to multiply (or divide) each term is called the common ratio.
## Flowchart to calculate Arithmetic and Geometric progression

This first part of the flowchart is just used to gather the data about the sequence it is about compute, by recieving a user input of the terms of the sequence and whether that sequence is arithmetic or geometric, the algorithm needs to know this as the calculations for working out the next term are different for each type of sequence.

This is the main bulk of the algorithm, first the algorithm checks if the user inputted arithmetic, if they did then the algorithm checks to see whether the 1st term is smaller than the second, this is so the algorithm knows whether the sequence is increasing or decreasing, then the algorithm calculates the common difference or 'd'. To do this, when the sequence is increasing, the first term is subtracted from the second term giving the common difference, that is then added to the last term to find the next term in the sequence. However when the sequence is decreasing the 2nd term is taken away from the first giving the common difference,which is then subtracted from the last term to give the next term in the sequence.

However if the user inputs geometric then the algorithm then needs to find the common ratio or 'r' which requires a different calculation to find. To find this the algorithm again checks to see whether the 1st term is smaller than the second, if it is that means that terms are being multiplied and if not that means the terms are being divided. If the terms are being multiplied, to find the common ratio the algorithm divides the second term by the first term, that the common ratio is multiplied into the last term to find the next term. Finally, when the terms are being divided, the common ratio is found by dividing the first term by the second term, then the last term is divided by the common ratio to find the next term. The last part of the algorithm is used to present the user with the new sequence with the calculated next term included.
