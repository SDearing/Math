# Integral Calculus to Solve Practical Problems Involving Area
Integral calculus is the function we use to calculate the area under a curve.

The theory behind integral calculus is to break the area under the curve into a infinite set of rectangles, then by working out the area of all the rectangles you can calculate the area under the curve.

## The Formula

Examples for a curve with the equation -x^2+4

![example](https://github.com/SDearing/Math/blob/master/Repo%20Assets/integrationexample.PNG)


example for a curve with the equation x^2 - 7x

(x^2+1/ 2+1) - (7x^1+1/ 1+1)
so the area under the curve will be x^3/3 - 7x^2/2 + c
